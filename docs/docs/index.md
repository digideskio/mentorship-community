# Welcome to the Mentorship Community Documentation

"Mentorship Community" is just a working title. A testimony to my boundless
imagination and creativity.

## Why do we need this?

I have worked hard since June 2015 to grow a PyLadies community in Singapore.
We have recently reached 100 members in our
[Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pyladiessg/), which is a great
achievement, but it's not going make a notable difference in the industry.

My goal is to scale the community up to 200 members before PyCon SG in June
2016 and to a 1000 members as soon as possible. I won't be able to do that as
a sole mentor, so some scalable solution is needed.

In order to scale up my current approach to PyLadies, a few things have to
change:

1. The lessons need to be much shorter, because preparing long talks is very
   time-consuming and straining. People always get lost halfway through long
   talks. It's harder to find venue for 3 hour meetups and it's harder to
   gather enough participants who want to code from 7-10pm right after work.
   It's almost impossible to attract other mentors who can use the existing
   slides because the slides are so complex.
1. The frequency of the lessons needs to increase. If you get exposed to
   programming only once a month or even just bi-weekly, that's not gonna be
   enough.
1. We need a clear curriculum of short topics that build on top of each other
   so that people are motivated to never miss a topic and have a sense of
   progress through the vast programming-landscape.

You could say "_Just use existing resources like Khan Academy_" and be done with
it! Here is why I think that such a community is still needed:

1. Many people have a hard time to keep themselves motivated. Self-teaching is
   a really really tough thing.
1. Even if you manage to self-teach yourself, finally stepping into the
   industry can be really hard when you have no supportive network of peers
   that help you find a suitable job, especially so in a society that places so
   much value on (mostly worthless) academic titles.

## How could this be solved?

I believe that it should be possible to build an engaging online-community with
the following features:

1. You can sign-up for an account and be both, mentor and mentee
1. You can see different "career-paths" which show a roadmap of lessons that
   you should learn in order to become a "hireable" person.
1. You can subscribe to lessons that you want to learn.
1. You can subscribe to lessons that you are able to teach.
1. When 5 people have clicked at the same lesson, the people who are able to
   teach it, will be notified. They will fill out a doodle with dates where
   they are available to teach. The mentees will vote on the best date,
   everyone will meet at some cafe and get it done.
1. The topics will be short. Everyone gets to do one small thing and the rest
   of the time will be spent with socializing and tinkering, in order to
   strengthen the feeling of being part of a real community and to internalize
   the thing that you have just learned.
1. You will be able to see what modules you have learned and in the end you can
   prove to potential employers that you have completed that career paths,
   including endorsements from your mentors that have given the lessons to
   you.
