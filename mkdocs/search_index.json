A testimony to my boundless\nimagination and creativity.\n\n\nWhy do we need this?\n\n\nI have worked hard since June 2015 to grow a PyLadies community in Singapore.\nWe have recently reached 100 members in our\n\nFacebook group\n, which is a great\nachievement, but it's not going make a notable difference in the industry.\n\n\nMy goal is to scale the community up to 200 members before PyCon SG in June\n2016 and to a 1000 members as soon as possible. I won't be able to do that as\na sole mentor, so some scalable solution is needed.\n\n\nIn order to scale up my current approach to PyLadies, a few things have to\nchange:\n\n\n\n\nThe lessons need to be much shorter, because preparing long talks is very\n   time-consuming and straining. People always get lost halfway through long\n   talks. It's harder to find venue for 3 hour meetups and it's harder to\n   gather enough participants who want to code from 7-10pm right after work.\n   It's almost impossible to attract other mentors who can use the existing\n   slides because the slides are so complex.\n\n\nThe frequency of the lessons needs to increase. If you get exposed to\n   programming only once a month or even just bi-weekly, that's not gonna be\n   enough.\n\n\nWe need a clear curriculum of short topics that build on top of each other\n   so that people are motivated to never miss a topic and have a sense of\n   progress through the vast programming-landscape.\n\n\n\n\nYou could say \"\nJust use existing resources like Khan Academy\n\" and be done with\nit! Here is why I think that such a community is still needed:\n\n\n\n\nMany people have a hard time to keep themselves motivated. Self-teaching is\n   a really really tough thing.\n\n\nEven if you manage to self-teach yourself, finally stepping into the\n   industry can be really hard when you have no supportive network of peers\n   that help you find a suitable job, especially so in a society that places so\n   much value on (mostly worthless) academic titles.\n\n\n\n\nHow could this be solved?\n\n\nI believe that it should be possible to build an engaging online-community with\nthe following features:\n\n\n\n\nYou can sign-up for an account and be both, mentor and mentee\n\n\nYou can see different \"career-paths\" which show a roadmap of lessons that\n   you should learn in order to become a \"hireable\" person.\n\n\nYou can subscribe to lessons that you want to learn.\n\n\nYou can subscribe to lessons that you are able to teach.\n\n\nWhen 5 people have clicked at the same lesson, the people who are able to\n   teach it, will be notified. They will fill out a doodle with dates where\n   they are available to teach. The mentees will vote on the best date,\n   everyone will meet at some cafe and get it done.\n\n\nThe topics will be short. Everyone gets to do one small thing and the rest\n   of the time will be spent with socializing and tinkering, in order to\n   strengthen the feeling of being part of a real community and to internalize\n   the thing that you have just learned.\n\n\nYou will be able to see what modules you have learned and in the end you can\n   prove to potential employers that you have completed that career paths,\n   including endorsements from your mentors that have given the lessons to\n   you.",
